/*
 * PREFACE
 * To be used with the CWD556 stepper driver or similar.
 * 
 * The arduino tone() function generates a square wave of the specified frequency.
 * Minimum frequency for the Uno is 31Hz = 31 pulses per second = 1Â 860 pulses per minute.
 * This means we have to put the CWD556 driver needs to have a pretty high pulse per rev setting. 
 * If we choose 25600 pulses per rev we get the following frequencies for 0.1rpm to 10rpm
 * 
 * 25600 steps/rev
 * 
 * 0.1 rpm = 2560 steps/min = 2560 pulses/min = 2560/60 = 42Hz
 * 10 rpm = 256000 steps/min = 256000 pulses/min = 25600/60 = 4266Hz = 4,267kHz
